# AI Fine-Tuning Project Plan

## Overview
This project plan outlines the tasks, resources, and timelines for developing a proof of concept (PoC) within 3 months and a minimum viable product (MVP) within 9 months for fine-tuning AI models for industry use cases (e.g., text, language, or physical AI like robotics, vision, audio). The plan aligns with the end-to-end process for use case identification, validation, model development, and deployment.
