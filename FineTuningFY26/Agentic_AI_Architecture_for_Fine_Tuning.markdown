# Agentic AI Architecture for AI Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview
This document evaluates the tasks from the AI fine-tuning project plan (3-month PoC and 9-month MVP) to identify which can be implemented using an agentic AI architecture. An agentic AI architecture involves autonomous AI agents that perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other systems or agents, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. Additionally, a Mermaid flowchart is provided to illustrate the design of the agentic AI system, detailing how agents collaborate to execute the identified tasks.

## Task Analysis for Agentic AI Suitability
Below, each task from the project plan is assessed for its suitability to be implemented or supported by an agentic AI architecture. Tasks are evaluated based on their potential for automation, decision-making, or integration with external systems. Tasks requiring significant human judgment (e.g., stakeholder alignment, SME validation) are less suitable for full automation but may involve AI agents for support functions.

### Summary of Agentic AI Suitability
- **High Suitability (12 tasks)**: Data-related tasks (T1.4, T1.5, T2.1, T4.1, T4.2), model-related tasks (T2.2, T2.3, T3.1, T4.3, T5.2, T6.2), and monitoring (T8.2, T9.1, T9.2) are ideal for agentic AI due to their repetitive, data-driven, or rule-based nature.
- **Medium Suitability (8 tasks)**: Tasks involving automation of workflows or documentation (T1.2, T3.4, T5.1, T5.3, T6.1, T6.4, T7.2, T7.3, T8.1, T8.3, T9.3) benefit from AI agents but require human oversight for customization or integration.
- **Low Suitability (3 tasks)**: Stakeholder/SME interactions (T1.1, T3.2, T6.3, T7.1) require human judgment, limiting full automation, though AI can support with preparatory tasks.

## Agentic AI Architecture Design
The agentic AI architecture is designed to support the high- and medium-suitability tasks identified above. It consists of specialized AI agents that collaborate to automate data collection, preprocessing, model selection, fine-tuning, testing, deployment, and monitoring. The system integrates with external tools (e.g., data catalogs, ML frameworks, cloud platforms) and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms for oversight.

   - **Function**: Scans data sources, collects/generates data, and automates preprocessing (cleaning, augmentation, splitting).
   - **Tools**: Connects to internal/external data sources, uses pandas/NLTK/OpenCV for preprocessing.
3. **Model Agent**:
   - **Tasks**: T2.2 (select model), T2.3 (fine-tune model), T3.1 (evaluate model), T4.3 (optimize/retrain).
   - **Function**: Evaluates model architectures, manages fine-tuning, optimizes hyperparameters, and computes performance metrics.
   - **Tools**: Interfaces with model zoos (Hugging Face), training pipelines (PyTorch/TensorFlow), and evaluation libraries (scikit-learn).
4. **Pipeline Agent**:
   - **Tasks**: T5.1 (design API), T5.2 (optimize model), T5.3 (integrate pipeline), T6.1 (deploy to staging), T6.2 (end-to-end testing), T8.1 (deploy to production).
   - **Function**: Generates API templates, optimizes models for deployment, automates integration testing, and manages deployments.
   - **Tools**: Uses FastAPI, ONNX Runtime, Kubernetes, and testing frameworks (pytest, Locust).
5. **Monitoring Agent**:
   - **Tasks**: T8.2 (initial monitoring), T9.1 (set up dashboards/alerts), T9.2 (retraining triggers).
   - **Function**: Monitors model performance, sets up dashboards/alerts, and triggers retraining based on performance drift.
   - **Tools**: Integrates with Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty, and MLflow.
6. **Human Oversight Interface**:
   - **Tasks**: Supports T1.1, T3.2, T6.3, T7.1 (human validation tasks), and all medium/low suitability tasks.
   - **Function**: Provides dashboards for human review (e.g., SME validation), approves agent outputs, and handles escalations for alerts.
   - **Tools**: Interfaces with collaboration platforms (Slack, Confluence) and visualization tools (Matplotlib, Tableau).

### Workflow
- **Initialization**: Use Case Agent extracts and validates use case details, coordinating with human stakeholders via the Oversight Interface.
- **Data Processing**: Data Agent collects and preprocesses data, passing it to the Model Agent.
- **Model Development**: Model Agent selects and fine-tunes models, evaluating performance and iterating based on feedback.
- **Pipeline Deployment**: Pipeline Agent builds and deploys the inference pipeline, integrating with external systems.
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring Agent tracks performance, triggers alerts, and initiates retraining if needed.
- **Human Oversight**: Humans review critical outputs (e.g., SME validation, deployment plans) and respond to alerts via the Oversight Interface.

### Benefits of Agentic AI
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive tasks (e.g., data preprocessing, model evaluation), reducing manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Modular agents can handle multiple use cases simultaneously.
- **Adaptability**: Supports diverse use cases (text, vision, robotics) by swapping tools/models.
- **Proactivity**: Monitoring Agent proactively detects issues and triggers retraining.

### Considerations
- **Human Oversight**: Critical for tasks requiring judgment (e.g., T1.1, T3.2). Agents prepare data/reports to streamline human input.
- **Tool Integration**: Agents must interface with existing tools (e.g., Jira, AWS), requiring robust APIs.
- **Error Handling**: Agents need fallback mechanisms for edge cases (e.g., data quality issues, model failures).
- **Security**: Ensure agents comply with data privacy (e.g., GDPR) and secure API access.
