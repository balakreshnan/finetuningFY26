# Architecture Blueprint for Fine-Tuning Tool with Governance

## Overview
This blueprint outlines a scalable architecture for a "Fine Tuning as a Service" platform, integrating fine-tuning, inference, dataset creation, governance, monitoring, and utilities. It ensures end-to-end visibility into model portfolios, secure access control, responsible AI practices, and industry-specific customization.
