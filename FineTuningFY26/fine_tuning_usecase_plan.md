| ------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Architect     | Use case qualification, solutioning   | 1                 |
| Data Engineer | Data preprocessing and formatting     | 1–2               |
| ML Engineer   | Fine-tuning, training, evaluation     | 1–2               |

| SME (Domain)  | Use case validation, annotation input | 1–2               |

#### 12.2 Time Estimation

- Simple fine-tuning: 3–4 weeks (QLoRA, 7B model)
- Full fine-tuning: 5–8 weeks (more data, larger models)
- RAG + tuning hybrid: 4–6 weeks

#### 12.3 Hardware Needs

| Model Size  | GPU Requirements                | Notes                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 7B (QLoRA)  | 1x A100 40GB or 2x L40s         | Budget-efficient, fast dev  |
| 13B–34B     | 2–4x A100 or H100 GPUs          | Multi-node support required |
| Full Tuning | High storage & memory (1TB SSD) | Slower, costlier            |

#### 12.4 Cost Estimation Factors

- GPU compute hours
- Storage & bandwidth
- Human resources (data prep, tuning, validation)
- Model hosting and monitoring

Use cloud calculators (AWS/GCP/Azure) or on-prem GPU server costs to calculate TCO.
